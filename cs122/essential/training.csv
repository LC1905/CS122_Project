Chef Noah Sandoval and Chef Genie Kwon are truly master artists in their craft.,What I can tell you is that it doesn't matter who you are you are treated with the same level of service and respect that they would treat a michelin food critic or Barack Obama. ,Plating is very thoughtful using various utensils including your hands. ,The meal was +ACQ-190/person before tax and tip.
+IBw-Not to be cliche or dramatic but I genuinely did not know food could even taste that way. +IB0-,Loved the extra touch where the server would walk me to the wash room every time.,The decor was contemporary and sleek.,the prices are reasonable and it's a great option for those whom have a hard time selecting one or two rolls.
The food is as delicious as it is pretty.,Service here is fantastic very professional but not overly formal and stuffy.,This is a wonderful little place in an unassuming strip plaza.,There are five different plate colors for tiered pricing purpose as follows.
Some of our favorites from the meal were the capellini and sourdough  A5 wagyu  squab and the kampachi.,Staff is very knowledgeable about the dishes and ingredients.,This is a very cozy location and it's a bit drafty in the Winter.,After finishing each plate you stack them up so that the server can calculate your bill in the end. 
 I can't rave enough about the dishes served. ,Pacing of the meal was a bit on the faster side., The restaurant is somewhat small but we have a birds eye view of the fishbowl kitchen.,Pricing was very fair.
There are a lot more dishes than those and they are all in the very good to outstanding category.,Service was top notch. ,The dining area is small with a mixture of booths and bar seats.,I pay about the same at the many mediocre Japanese restaurants that inhabit the city.
+ACI-There wasn't a bad bite in the meal, with every dish ranging from good to amazing.+ACI-,Service during the meal was friendly.,The decor is pretty modern and minimalist and the dining area is pretty well+AC0-lit and bright.,BEWARE the price can get scary if you've been spoiled with all you can eat sushi. 
This was the best pasta we had outside of Italy. ,+ACI-The service provided by Aaron, Alexander and John was impeccable. +ACI-,The sad thing was it seems like the wait staff was clueless on how to us their computer system.,I eat a lot and I racked up about +ACQ-60 just in sushi.
The pasta was cooked perfectly  sauce was not overdone and then you shave some truffles over it and you have perfection+ACE-,+ACI-Overall, a high end experience, the staff are attentive and well versed.+ACI-,Yes it is a bit kitschy yes it's small yes you'll have to wait 30 or more minutes.,Nicely priced options+AC0- 3 ladies gorged on sushi plus dessert and got out at +ACQ-50 total.  
Our favorite course of the nice was the pasta course. ,The service here was good +AC0ALQ- there were only 2 people covering the front as well as providing the service for the entire restaurant but they seemed fairly attentive and checked up on us often. ,While the new layout has smaller tables and it's more cramped I feel like they paid more attention to design so it looks like a real restaurant not just this weird little hole+AC0-in+AC0-the+AC0-wall.,In the end it was kinda pricey since there were 6 of us and each pair paid anything from +ACQ-70+AC0AJA-100+-.
The portions were very small.,We joked that the restaurant would delay our orders on purpose to tempt us to grab something off the conveyer belt but our orders came out pretty quickly. ,The old layout didn't have as many tables and this place gets crowded fast.,Saddest part they added a mandatory 18+ACU- on each of the 3 bills. 
Overall the food was okay nothing spectacular. ,The staff was attentive and helpful.,Decor was a real plus with their new design.,Sushi was okay it was a little bit overpriced nothing really special.
The food was so damn good and so worth the money.,Service is nice but it's apparent that there is (still) a slight miscommunication and settling in period. ,This place was so clean and nicely decorated+ACE- ,Prices weren't offensive +AC0- +ACQ-35 for two of us...but neither of us left full because we stopped eating.
The lamb was very tasty with the rapini but it needed something.,It gets somewhat sketchy if you go really late at night. ,this was the most uncomfortable seating arrangement.,The only reason why I'm giving it a 4 star is because of the cost.
The noodles were pretty average but everything else about the ramen was amazing. ,+ACI-Service was great, as we were regularly tended to and they cleared our tables and refilled waters promptly.+ACI-,The place is small to begin with and the tables and chairs are huge which makes it difficult to actually sit down...,It is a bit costlier than your traditional Chinese fair but if you're looking for something a little off the traditional path it's worth a try+ACE-
The pork was the real standout +AC0- soft melt+AC0-in+AC0-your+AC0-mouth tenderness.,Lastly the service is not amazing either.,The tables touched my knees so I had no room to cross my legs and the chair is so far away from the table I was afraid of spilling stuff on myself+ACE- ,Not too expensive either if you keep the drinks under control.
The egg was perfectly cooked and the broth was perfectly seasoned (great for a chilly night)+ACE- ,Nobody checks up on you ever.,+ACI-The seats are not that comfortable though, as the tables are super low and my leg was essentially pinched..+ACI-,The meal was reasonably priced +AC0- +ACQ-60 each pre tip with one cocktail each.
The mochi was tasty and well+AC0-priced as well+ACE-,Upon walking in we were greeted and seated immediately.,The restaurant isn't that big and the wait can be long.,The prices were high for the portion sizes
Both tasted great and were unique from other rolls I've tried before.,The service was excellent.,Visiting after they remodeled and I loved their decor. ,
 My favorite dishes were the green plate ones that included the Snow Ball (super white tuna scallion and chili oil) Spicy Tuna Roll and Chocolate Mousse. ,They checked up on us frequently and tried to remove whatever they could from the table. ,The inside is very clean.,
The fish were really fresh and delicious+ACE-,There was only 2 servers on that night that we went too it was really hard to order and ask for more water.,I was floured by the beautiful decor.,
They also had some dessert items on the conveyor belt along with seaweed and squid salads.,+ACI-The service can be a bit spotty at times and if they can figure that out, this place would be awesome.  +ACI-,It's all white(my fav) which was smart because it makes the space look much bigger than it really is.,
We tried the green tea cheesecake and this was alright.,+ACI- In addition, there seems to be no set servers per table so I couldn't properly explain what had happened when another server brought us our food and a completely different server got us our check.+ACI-,There is also tons of greenery around the resturant(other fav) giving it a really fresh and hip feeling.,
The fish is great quality the rolls are diverse and they have desert+ACE-,The wait is a bit long during their busy hours+ACE-,The interior design is right up my alley.,
The ramen is meh the quality of the noodles aren't there.,We waited for a table and then waited quite a while for the food.,Clean white walls lined with fresh plants and cone shaped metal light fixtures.,
The beef options are also really bad. ,service also seemed pretty busy.,To start the location is a bit outside of the usual restaurant row.,
All the sushi rolls we had were very delicious. ,To be honest the waiters werent rude or dismissive of our concerns that the food was taking a long time to come.,The decor of Eden is just my style.,
It was not any less tasty than any regular sushi places. ,We were seated immediately and our server explained the menu.,Black white and gray/silver decor covers the entire restaurant. ,
Soup tasted weak noodle were overcooked and it was served barely luke warm.,He was really friendly and did an excellent job checking in on us the first half of our meal but after they removed our entrees it seemed as if he had gone missing?,it was very loud.,
Surprisingly the Ramen soup was really good. ,We were a little disappointed about this especially because all of the reviews we had read called out the astounding service.,There are no curtains or carpet in the restaurant.,
Overall I think they need to mind their ingredients a bit more and pay extra attention to keeping things fresh for serving.,The waiter and staff are incredibly friendly.,The  restaurant is very nice simple and elegant.,
Dumplings are good but nothing special.,the service was attentive and genuine.,I loved the decor simple and clean.,
Tastes like eating steak that sat in the fridge overnight.,Everyone+AC0ALQ-the hostesses the waitress the servers and the managers+AC0ALQ-were really working to ensure that guests had a great dining experience.,The tables had fresh cacti very romantic and candle light around the rooms. ,
Dumplings here are pretty awesome as well as the skewers of meat.,we experienced great service the entire time. ,Loved the romantic atmosphere.,
I would recommend the steamed and fried dumplings +AC0- pork and cabbage is always a classic but they have tons of options here.,Our water glasses were never running low we never had to wait long to order another drink and the staff was very friendly and helpful.,The decor is very light and fresh.,
The boiled dumplings had juice in them so if you're looking for something soupier/juicier definitely get the boiled dumplings if you don't want to wait for the steamed.,The hostess are very sweet and pleasant.,It was very clean and pristine.,
There are many different flavors and you can try them in three styles +IBM- boiled steamed or fried (potsticker).,I like to thank the owner for making us feel welcome and special.,They also have a greenhouse just outside the restaurant which really hints at the freshness and seasonality of the food.,
The ingredients were good quality and even my girlfriend who doesnt like chives liked the beef and chive dumplings.,From the host stand to the servers to the bartenders.,Great atmosphere they have their own Greenhouse for vegetables and the staff is very knowledgeable on how the food is prepared,
The dumplings are made fresh to order which means they are soft and juicy and not sticking to the plate.,She was very knowledgeable about the wine selections/cocktails and gave us wonderful recommendations.,the decor was clean agrarian and modern.,
Both starters were good but a little boring.,The waiter took our food order and wasn't very happy i wasn't drinking. ,Modern bright (and alive) decor filled the room and it felt very cozy despite being in an area that is not known to be particularly safe (few blocks north of the United center.),
The semolina gnocchi dish was very good for a vegetarian dish but my friend still felt hungry after.,The quality of service dropped from there.,The decor is lovely but casual.,
For example the chicken soup was big and filling but the salad felt very light.,We waited almost an hour for our food after the donuts.,,
Similarly the gnocci was very light but the pork dish was huge+ACE-,Trying to get the waiter's attention to pay the bill was challenging.,,
Also the chocolate caprese was a wonderfully creative dish that I can't out of my head.,The positive part of the service is that the bus girl was very attentive and nice.,,
+ACI-The basil sherbert was so tart, but it paired perfectly with the sweet chocolate and milk ricotta. +ACI-,Only received 4 stars due to their rude female bartender who shouldn't be working for them.,,
For starters I was recommended to try their umami doughnuts with braised striploin stuffing and whipped cream raclette.,The service was a little slow but the bus boys are extremely attentive always refilling waters and cleaning the table and replacing plates. ,,
The lamb loin entre+AOk- was nicely prepared and serves up a colorful profile of flavors.,the staff is friendly and knowledgeable and food is amazing+ACE-,,
From their  olives cubes of pistachios yogurt to high quality slices of lamb.,,,
Tasted neither gamey nor musky that I disfavor in lamb meat. ,,,
For dessert the chocolate crunch is a self explanatory winner.,,,
Fresh savory beautiful.,,,
I love bone marrow dishes.,,,
I liked that although this dish did have butter to make it rich and savory it was not too oily like some other bone marrow dishes. ,,,
The root vegetables added a nice contrast and the toast added a nice texture to the dish.,,,
I really liked the few pieces of montamore cheese.,,,
There were a few pieces of what seemed to be very toasted peanuts that added an interesting texture.,,,
Berbere Spiced Lentil +ACY- Grilled Chicken Soup with grilled baguette: flavorful. The chicken was very tender. ,,,
At first bite the lemon+AC0-thyme sorbet made me pucker my face because it was sour.,,,
after combining all the different elements of the dish made it complex balanced and delicious.,,,
I loved the food I complimented the chefs for serving such delicious dishes.,,,
We also got the Umami Donuts +AC0- this has to be one of the most unique starters I have ever tried. ,,,
For first course we tried the Bone Marrow +AC0- this was my first experience eating it.,,,
I was pleased by the texture and flavors.,,,
The salsa that comes with it was amazing and the bread was perfect.,,,
We split a few things for our main course +AC0- Pork Tagliatelle Strip Loin Portuguese Spiced Chicken +ACY- the Gnocchi.,,,
My favorite was the Pork Tagliatelle +AC0- the noodles are 100+ACU- homemade you can really taste the difference here.,,,
We split one dessert +AC0- Lemon+AC0-Granny Smith Apple Namelaka +AC0- the olive oil cake was insane and the sauce that was on the bottom I could have eaten with a spoon.,,,
The unami donuts were dry and didn't have a lot of flavor without the sauce.,,,
when the food came out it was cold.,,,
my boyfriend's steak was cold chewy and overwhelmed by garlic.,,,
drinks were creative and food was fantastic.,,,
The namelaka dessert was a delightful finish to a rather hearty dinner. ,,,
the cocktail menu is unique and each cocktail was distinctly different and well edited just like their dishes.,,,
Every single dish was well thought out and edited. ,,,
I love homemade pasta but the richness and the touch of sweet apples made this pasta stand out.,,,
One person had the lentil +ACY- grilled chicken soup which was very flavorful.,,,
I had the catch of the day and it was delicious.,,,
The Smoked Tarjin pasta was one of our favorites dishes at Eden.,,,
Truly no way to describe it +AC0- savory meat filled dough balls covered in seasoning. ,,,
This pasta was our second favorite dish followed by the beet salad.,,,
The lamb was the best I have ever had.,,,
The recommended wine was a great pairing.,,,
both desserts were fabulous and if you like texture try these.,,,
The food was great creative dishes.,,,
Bone marrow appetizer decadent. ,,,
Specials were very good.,,,
The doughnut appetizers are a must+ACE-,,,
Chocolate and citrus desserts amazing as well.,,,
Everything is so fresh and tasty.,,,
