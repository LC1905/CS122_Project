Chef Noah Sandoval and Chef Genie Kwon are truly master artists in their craft.,What I can tell you is that it doesn't matter who you are you are treated with the same level of service and respect that they would treat a michelin food critic or Barack Obama. ,Plating is very thoughtful using various utensils including your hands. ,The meal was +ACQ-190/person before tax and tip.
+IBw-Not to be cliche or dramatic but I genuinely did not know food could even taste that way. +IB0-,Loved the extra touch where the server would walk me to the wash room every time.,The decor was contemporary and sleek.,the prices are reasonable and it's a great option for those whom have a hard time selecting one or two rolls.
The food is as delicious as it is pretty.,Service here is fantastic very professional but not overly formal and stuffy.,This is a wonderful little place in an unassuming strip plaza.,There are five different plate colors for tiered pricing purpose as follows.
Some of our favorites from the meal were the capellini and sourdough  A5 wagyu  squab and the kampachi.,Staff is very knowledgeable about the dishes and ingredients.,This is a very cozy location and it's a bit drafty in the Winter.,After finishing each plate you stack them up so that the server can calculate your bill in the end. 
 I can't rave enough about the dishes served. ,Pacing of the meal was a bit on the faster side., The restaurant is somewhat small but we have a birds eye view of the fishbowl kitchen.,Pricing was very fair.
There are a lot more dishes than those and they are all in the very good to outstanding category.,Service was top notch. ,The dining area is small with a mixture of booths and bar seats.,I pay about the same at the many mediocre Japanese restaurants that inhabit the city.
+ACI-There wasn't a bad bite in the meal, with every dish ranging from good to amazing.+ACI-,Service during the meal was friendly.,The decor is pretty modern and minimalist and the dining area is pretty well+AC0-lit and bright.,BEWARE the price can get scary if you've been spoiled with all you can eat sushi. 
This was the best pasta we had outside of Italy. ,+ACI-The service provided by Aaron, Alexander and John was impeccable. +ACI-,The sad thing was it seems like the wait staff was clueless on how to us their computer system.,I eat a lot and I racked up about +ACQ-60 just in sushi.
The pasta was cooked perfectly  sauce was not overdone and then you shave some truffles over it and you have perfection+ACE-,+ACI-Overall, a high end experience, the staff are attentive and well versed.+ACI-,Yes it is a bit kitschy yes it's small yes you'll have to wait 30 or more minutes.,Nicely priced options+AC0- 3 ladies gorged on sushi plus dessert and got out at +ACQ-50 total.  
Our favorite course of the nice was the pasta course. ,The service here was good +AC0ALQ- there were only 2 people covering the front as well as providing the service for the entire restaurant but they seemed fairly attentive and checked up on us often. ,While the new layout has smaller tables and it's more cramped I feel like they paid more attention to design so it looks like a real restaurant not just this weird little hole+AC0-in+AC0-the+AC0-wall.,In the end it was kinda pricey since there were 6 of us and each pair paid anything from +ACQ-70+AC0AJA-100+-.
The portions were very small.,We joked that the restaurant would delay our orders on purpose to tempt us to grab something off the conveyer belt but our orders came out pretty quickly. ,The old layout didn't have as many tables and this place gets crowded fast.,Saddest part they added a mandatory 18+ACU- on each of the 3 bills. 
Overall the food was okay nothing spectacular. ,The staff was attentive and helpful.,Decor was a real plus with their new design.,Sushi was okay it was a little bit overpriced nothing really special.
The food was so damn good and so worth the money.,Service is nice but it's apparent that there is (still) a slight miscommunication and settling in period. ,This place was so clean and nicely decorated+ACE- ,Prices weren't offensive +AC0- +ACQ-35 for two of us...but neither of us left full because we stopped eating.
The lamb was very tasty with the rapini but it needed something.,It gets somewhat sketchy if you go really late at night. ,this was the most uncomfortable seating arrangement.,The only reason why I'm giving it a 4 star is because of the cost.
The noodles were pretty average but everything else about the ramen was amazing. ,+ACI-Service was great, as we were regularly tended to and they cleared our tables and refilled waters promptly.+ACI-,The place is small to begin with and the tables and chairs are huge which makes it difficult to actually sit down...,It is a bit costlier than your traditional Chinese fair but if you're looking for something a little off the traditional path it's worth a try+ACE-
The pork was the real standout +AC0- soft melt+AC0-in+AC0-your+AC0-mouth tenderness.,Lastly the service is not amazing either.,The tables touched my knees so I had no room to cross my legs and the chair is so far away from the table I was afraid of spilling stuff on myself+ACE- ,
The egg was perfectly cooked and the broth was perfectly seasoned (great for a chilly night)+ACE- ,Nobody checks up on you ever.,+ACI-The seats are not that comfortable though, as the tables are super low and my leg was essentially pinched..+ACI-,
The mochi was tasty and well+AC0-priced as well+ACE-,Upon walking in we were greeted and seated immediately.,The restaurant isn't that big and the wait can be long.,
Both tasted great and were unique from other rolls I've tried before.,The service was excellent.,Visiting after they remodeled and I loved their decor. ,
 My favorite dishes were the green plate ones that included the Snow Ball (super white tuna scallion and chili oil) Spicy Tuna Roll and Chocolate Mousse. ,They checked up on us frequently and tried to remove whatever they could from the table. ,The inside is very clean.,
The fish were really fresh and delicious+ACE-,There was only 2 servers on that night that we went too it was really hard to order and ask for more water.,I was floured by the beautiful decor.,
They also had some dessert items on the conveyor belt along with seaweed and squid salads.,+ACI-The service can be a bit spotty at times and if they can figure that out, this place would be awesome.  +ACI-,It's all white(my fav) which was smart because it makes the space look much bigger than it really is.,
We tried the green tea cheesecake and this was alright.,+ACI- In addition, there seems to be no set servers per table so I couldn't properly explain what had happened when another server brought us our food and a completely different server got us our check.+ACI-,There is also tons of greenery around the resturant(other fav) giving it a really fresh and hip feeling.,
The fish is great quality the rolls are diverse and they have desert+ACE-,The wait is a bit long during their busy hours+ACE-,,
The ramen is meh the quality of the noodles aren't there.,We waited for a table and then waited quite a while for the food.,,
The beef options are also really bad. ,service also seemed pretty busy.,,
All the sushi rolls we had were very delicious. ,To be honest the waiters werent rude or dismissive of our concerns that the food was taking a long time to come.,,
It was not any less tasty than any regular sushi places. ,We were seated immediately and our server explained the menu.,,
Soup tasted weak noodle were overcooked and it was served barely luke warm.,He was really friendly and did an excellent job checking in on us the first half of our meal but after they removed our entrees it seemed as if he had gone missing?,,
Surprisingly the Ramen soup was really good. ,We were a little disappointed about this especially because all of the reviews we had read called out the astounding service.,,
Overall I think they need to mind their ingredients a bit more and pay extra attention to keeping things fresh for serving.,,,
Dumplings are good but nothing special.,,,
Tastes like eating steak that sat in the fridge overnight.,,,
Dumplings here are pretty awesome as well as the skewers of meat.,,,
I would recommend the steamed and fried dumplings +AC0- pork and cabbage is always a classic but they have tons of options here.,,,
The boiled dumplings had juice in them so if you're looking for something soupier/juicier definitely get the boiled dumplings if you don't want to wait for the steamed.,,,
There are many different flavors and you can try them in three styles +IBM- boiled steamed or fried (potsticker).,,,
The ingredients were good quality and even my girlfriend who doesnt like chives liked the beef and chive dumplings.,,,
The dumplings are made fresh to order which means they are soft and juicy and not sticking to the plate.,,,
Both starters were good but a little boring.,,,
The semolina gnocchi dish was very good for a vegetarian dish but my friend still felt hungry after.,,,
For example the chicken soup was big and filling but the salad felt very light.,,,
